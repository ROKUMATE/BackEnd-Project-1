We use app.use => {
    When we mostly do Configurational settings or the middelware Settings
    cros = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing [used to connect the ForntEnd to the BackEnd]
}

CookieParser => {
    use: (
        server see Cookies accept and action perferm kar pao 
    )
}

MiddleWare => {
    whatis: (
        
    )
}

/*
In the Express request methods
    we mostly will use ...
    req.body
    req.params
    req.cookie
*/


// For Password Hashing we will use the bcrypt lib
// For web token we will use jwt (Json Web Token)  

// the hardest and most challenging part of this project is the videoHistory setup => {
     for that we are gonna use the mongodb Aggregation pipiline lib
}

// JWT -=> {
    it is a bearer token {
        anyone have this token they can access the data 
    }
    {
        we only give the refresh token to the user database
    }
}

// Mongoose MiddleWare => { We Want to encrypt our passwrod just before it is saved in the database }
// for that we use the Pre Hooks
// userSchema.pre("save", () => {}) // Never write like this (As in arrow function we dont have teh referance to "this")
// and we use async as it takes time for encrypting and decrypting as well


For File Uploading we are using the toolkit / Lib named as "multer" , "fs (File System module by nodejs)" => {
    site => [https://github.com/expressjs/multer]

    to remove a file we will use the unlink technique[]
